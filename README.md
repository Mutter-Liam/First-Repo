2. To me a math puzzle in CICS is a puzzle that on the surface doesn't seem like it has anything to do with math, but can be converted in mathmatical algorithims and solved.

3. One puzzle that I've really enjoyed is an online puzzle game called Notpron. You have to analyze very abstract clues via the source code of the website or hidden images. It's super challenging but very rewarding.
